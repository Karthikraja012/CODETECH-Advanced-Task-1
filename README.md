#### **Objective**
The project aims to demonstrate the capability of handling and analyzing large datasets using **Dask**, a powerful parallel computing framework, and to derive insights from big data processing. The project includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning model training, and visualization of results to fulfill the requirements of a data analysis internship task.

#### **Steps Involved**

1. **Data Generation**:
   - A synthetic dataset with 5 million rows and 3 features is generated using NumPy.
   - This large dataset is used to simulate real-world big data scenarios.

2. **Data Loading**:
   - The dataset is converted into a **Dask DataFrame** to leverage parallel processing capabilities.
   - This approach ensures scalability and efficiency when working with large datasets.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Missing values** are checked and handled.
   - Basic **statistical summaries** such as sums and means are calculated.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - A linear regression model is trained using **Dask-ML** to predict the target variable based on input features.
   - This step demonstrates the use of distributed machine learning with large datasets.

5. **Data Saving**:
   - The processed data is saved in **Parquet format**, a popular columnar storage format for big data, which supports efficient data storage and retrieval.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Predictions are made using the trained linear regression model.
   - The accuracy and performance of the model are evaluated using the predicted and actual target values.

7. **Visualization**:
   - **Scatter plots** are used to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted values, providing a clear view of the model's performance.
   - A **residuals distribution** plot helps assess the goodness of fit of the model.

#### **Key Deliverables**

- A **Python script** or **Jupyter notebook** that includes:
  - The code for loading, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
  - Insights derived from big data processing.
  - A trained machine learning model and its performance evaluation.

- **Visualizations** that provide clear insights into the model's performance:
  - Actual vs. Predicted values plot.
  - Residuals distribution plot.

#### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for handling, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets using Dask, from data ingestion to model evaluation and visualization. The approach showcases the ability to scale data processing and machine learning tasks, making it suitable for real-world big data applications. The final deliverables meet the requirements for the internship task by providing a comprehensive analysis and visualization of big data.
